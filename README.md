# Yet Another Fitness Tracker

### NOTE: this project is an active work in progress

Fitness trackers are too fancy. They keep track of your lifts, your
routes for running, and they track *way* too many details about your
diet. Then there's all that Fitbit integration, phone apps, web
apps—that kind of thing.

I just want something simple:

+ keep track of my weight
+ keep track of my calories consumed
+ graph the above and give me trajectories

So that's what this is meant to do. Command line. Simple. Less
featureful than every other fitness tracker—and in the best way
possible.
